# Sentiment Analysis Application

A basic frontend with a FastAPI backend to perform sentiment analysis on user-provided prompts. The motivation was to outgrow Streamlit.

## Quick start

First, make sure you have docker installed, then run:

```
docker compose up
```

Now go to `localhost:8080` in your web browser.
